# Cloud Firestore ODM

The Cloud Firestore ODM package enables developers to build fully type-safe applications for Flutter
using the [FlutterFire Cloud Firestore plugin](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/firestore/overview).

## What does it do?

The ODM allows data schemas to be defined which represent the data structure of your Cloud
Firestore database. By defining schemas the ODM provides the following benefits:

- ↔️ Bi-directional data validation.
- 🔒 Type-safe data querying, supporting all Firestore query operations.
- 🔄 Flutter Widgets for simple data binding with your data.
- 🎯 Data selectors to help avoid unnecessary Widget rebuilds.
- 💻 Full API code completion.
