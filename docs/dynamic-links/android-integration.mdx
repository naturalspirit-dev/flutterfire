## Configure your App in the Firebase Console

Create a SHA-256 fingerprint using these [instructions](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth) for your app,
and add to your app in your Firebase console.

Next, go to the following location in your browser `[your-domain]/.well-known/assetlinks.json`. The response will have a target object
containing a "package_name" which ought to have your app's package name. Please do not proceed until you see this, it may take a while to register.

## AndroidManifest.xml Configuration

Add your deep link domains to your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` so your app can receive the Dynamic Link data after it is installed/updated
from the Play Store.  Refer to the official docs to illustrate [setup](https://firebase.google.com/docs/dynamic-links/android/receive#add-an-intent-filter-for-deep-links).

For example:

```xml
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW"/>
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE"/>
    <data
        android:host="example.com"
        android:scheme="https"/>
</intent-filter>
```
