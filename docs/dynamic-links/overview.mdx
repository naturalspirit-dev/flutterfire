## What does it do?

Dynamic Links are links that work the way you want, on multiple platforms, and whether or not your app is already installed.
If a user opens a Dynamic Link on iOS or Android, they can be taken directly to the linked content in your native app.
If a user doesn't have your app installed, the user can be prompted to install it; then, after installation, your app starts
and can access the link.
