## What does it do?

If you use custom [TensorFlow Lite models](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/), Firebase ML can help you ensure your users are always using the best-available version of
your custom model. When you deploy your model with Firebase, Firebase ML only downloads the model when it's needed and automatically
updates your users with the latest version.

Once downloaded, you can use packages such as [tflite](https://pub.dev/packages/tflite) and [tfline_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/tflite_flutter)
to interpret your model.

> Google does not recommend usage of any specific interpreter and leaves it up to the user to decide.
