:::


## What does it do?

If you use custom [TensorFlow Lite models](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/), Firebase ML can help you ensure your users are always using the best-available version of
your custom model. When you deploy your model with Firebase, Firebase ML only downloads the model when it's needed and automatically
updates your users with the latest version.

Once downloaded, you can use packages such as [tflite_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/tflite_flutter)
to interpret your model.

## Installation

### 1. Make sure to initialize Firebase

[Follow this guide](../overview.mdx) to install `firebase_core` and initialize Firebase if you haven't already.

### 2. Add dependency

On the root of your Flutter project, run the following command to install the plugin:

```bash
flutter pub add firebase_ml_model_downloader
```

### 3. Rebuild your app

Once complete, rebuild your Flutter application:

```bash
flutter run
```

## Next Steps

Once installed, you're ready to start using ML Model Downloader in your Flutter Project.

View the [Usage documentation](usage.mdx) to get started.
