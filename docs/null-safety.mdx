title: Null Safety
---

Dart [Sound null safety](https://dart.dev/null-safety) is currently in beta. Some FlutterFire packages
have preview versions of null safety implementations available to use. Please note, not all
packages have been converted - we are working through them as quickly as possible.

> At this time it is not possible to mix non-null safe and null safe versions of FlutterFire.

View the [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire/discussions/4182) for more information.

The below table outlines the currently published and available null safe plugin versions:

|                 Plugin |                                  Version |
