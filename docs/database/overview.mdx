## What does it do?

The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and
synchronized in realtime to every connected client. When you build cross-platform apps Flutter & Firebase,
all of your clients can share one Realtime Database instance and automatically receive updates with the newest data.
