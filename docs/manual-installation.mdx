:::caution

Manual installation is not the recommended installation flow. These guides are for existing applications
using FlutterFire.

:::

In previous versions of FlutterFire, in order to add Firebase to your projects manual platform
specific steps were required, such as downloading a `google-services.json` file for Android,
downloading a `GoogleService-Info.plist` file for iOS or editing your `index.html` file for web.

FlutterFire now supports [initialization from Dart](./overview.mdx#initializing-flutterfire) using
the [FlutterFire CLI](./cli).

The new Dart-only initialization is fully backwards compatible with previous versions of FlutterFire -
if you have an existing project with manual initialization, this will continue to work.

## Platform setup

If you wish to continue to manually install Firebase on your platforms, please read the following
guides:

1. [Android Installation](./manual-installation/android.mdx)
1. [iOS Installation](./manual-installation/ios.mdx)
1. [MacOS Installation](./manual-installation/macos.mdx)
1. [Web Installation](./manual-installation/web.mdx)

## Migrating to Dart-only initialization

If you wish to migrate to the Dart-only initialization flow, some steps are required for your
existing applications.

:::caution

Please backup / branch your code before migrating.

:::


### Android

1. Remove the `/android/app/google-services.json` file.
1. Remove the `google-services` dependency from the `/android/build.gradle` file:
```diff title="android/build.gradle"
 buildscript {
   dependencies {
     // ... other dependencies
-    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:{{ android.google_services }}'
   }
 }
```
3. Remove the plugin execution via the `/android/app/build.gradle` file:
```diff
- apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

### iOS

Using Xcode, open the project's `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` file, then delete the `GoogleService-Info.plist`
file located in the file browser.

### macOS

Using Xcode, open the project's `macos/Runner.xcworkspace` file, then delete the `GoogleService-Info.plist`
file located in the file browser.

### Web

1. Remove any Firebase SDK scripts from your `web/index.html` file, for example:
```diff title="web/index.html"
 <html>
   ...
   <body>
-    <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/{{ web.firebase_cdn }}/firebase-app.js"></script>
-    <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/{{ web.firebase_cdn }}/firebase-firestore.js"></script>

     <script src="main.dart.js" type="application/javascript"></script>
   </body>
 </html>
```
2. Remove any `firebase.initializeApp()` logic and configuration from the `web/index.html` file:
```diff title="web/index.html"
 <html>
   ...
   <body>

    <script>
-     var firebaseConfig = { ... };
-     firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
    </script>
```

## Overriding Firebase SDK Versions

FlutterFire internally sets the versions of the Firebase SDKs that each module uses. Each release is tested against a fixed
set of SDK version to ensure everything works as expected.

If you wish to change these versions, you can manually override the native SDK versions

### Android

In the `/android/app/build.gradle` file, you can provide your own versions using the options shown below:

```groovy
rootProject.ext {
  set('FlutterFire', [
    FirebaseSDKVersion: '29.0.0'
  ])
}
```

### iOS/macOS

Open your `/ios/Podfile` or `/macos/Podfile` file and add any of the globals below to the top of the file:

```ruby
# Override Firebase SDK Version
$FirebaseSDKVersion = '8.10.0'
```
