title: CLI
---

The FlutterFire CLI is a useful tool which provides commands to help ease the installation process
of FlutterFire across all supported platforms.

To install the CLI, run the following command:

```bash
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
```

Once installed, the `flutterfire` command will be globally available.

## Commands

### Configure

Generates a `firebase_options.dart` file which can be provided to the `options` parameter when
[Initializing Firebase](./overview#initialization).

The `configure` command attempts to find relatable Android, iOS, macOS and Web apps from a
chosen Firebase Project. The command supports creating new Firebase Projects on the fly,
auto-detection of the correct platform app using an existing Flutter project and generating
cross-platform `firebase_options.dart` file.

Within the root of your Flutter project, run the following command:

```
flutterfire configure
```

To view all options, such as specifying a project or account email, run:

```
flutterfire configure --help
```

## Version

To view the current version of the CLI, run:

```bash
flutterfire --version
```
