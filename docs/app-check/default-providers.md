# Enable App Check in Flutter apps

This page shows you how to enable App Check in a Flutter app, using the
default providers: SafetyNet on Android, Device Check on Apple platforms, and
reCAPTCHA v3 on web. When you enable App Check, you help ensure that
only your app can access your project's Firebase resources. See an
[Overview](overview) of this feature.


## 1. Set up your Firebase project {:#project-setup}

1.  [Install and initialize FlutterFire](/docs/flutter/setup) if you haven't
    already done so.

1.  Register your apps to use App Check with the SafetyNet, Device Check, and reCAPTCHA providers in the
    [**Project Settings > App Check**](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/appcheck)
    section of the Firebase console.

    You usually need to register all of your project's apps, because once you
    enable enforcement for a Firebase product, only registered apps will be able
    to access the product's backend resources.

1.  **Optional**: In the app registration settings, set a custom time-to-live
    (TTL) for App Check tokens issued by the provider. You can set the TTL
    to any value between 30 minutes and 7 days. When changing this value, be
    aware of the following tradeoffs:

    - Security: Shorter TTLs provide stronger security, because it reduces the
      window in which a leaked or intercepted token can be abused by an
      attacker.
    - Performance: Shorter TTLs mean your app will perform attestation more
      frequently. Because the app attestation process adds latency to network
      requests every time it's performed, a short TTL can impact the performance
      of your app.
    - Quota and cost: Shorter TTLs and frequent re-attestation deplete your
      quota faster, and for paid services, potentially cost more.
      See [Quotas &amp; limits](/docs/app-check#quotas_limits).

    The default TTL
    is reasonable for most apps. Note that the App Check library refreshes
    tokens at approximately half the TTL duration.


## 2. Add the App Check library to your app {:#install-sdk}

1.  From the root of your Flutter project, run the following command to install the plugin:

    ```bash
    flutter pub add firebase_app_check
    ```

1.  Once complete, rebuild your Flutter application:

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```


## 3. Initialize App Check {:#initialize}

Add the following initialization code to your app so that it runs before you
use any Firebase services such as Storage, but after calling
`Firebase.initializeApp()`;

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';

// Import the firebase_app_check plugin
import 'package:firebase_app_check/firebase_app_check.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
  await FirebaseAppCheck.instance.activate(
    webRecaptchaSiteKey: 'recaptcha-v3-site-key',
  );
  runApp(App());
}
```

Once the App Check library is installed in your app, start distributing the
updated app to your users.

The updated client app will begin sending App Check tokens along with every
request it makes to Firebase, but Firebase products will not require the tokens
to be valid until you enable enforcement in the App Check section of the
Firebase console. See the next two sections for details.


## 4. Monitor request metrics {:#metrics}

Now that your updated app is in the hands of users, you can enable enforcement
of App Check for the Firebase products you use. Before you do so, however,
you should make sure that doing so wonâ€™t disrupt your existing legitimate users.

### Realtime Database, Cloud Firestore, and Cloud Storage {:#metrics-other}

An important tool you can use to make this decision for Realtime Database,
Cloud Firestore, and Cloud Storage is the App Check request metrics screen.

To view the App Check request metrics for a product, open the
[**Project Settings > App Check**](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/appcheck)
section of the Firebase console. For example:

<img src="/docs/app-check/app-check-metrics.png"
     alt="Screenshot of the App Check metrics page"
     class="screenshot"/>

The request metrics for each product are broken down into four categories:

- **Verified** requests are those that have a valid App Check token. After
  you enable App Check enforcement, only requests in this category will
  succeed.

- **Outdated client** requests are those that are missing an App Check
  token. These requests might be from an older version of the Firebase SDK
  before App Check was included in the app.

- **Unknown origin** requests are those that are missing an App Check token,
  and don't look like they come from the Firebase SDK. These might be from
  requests made with stolen API keys or forged requests made without the
  Firebase SDK.

- **Invalid** requests are those that have an invalid
  App Check token, which might be from an inauthentic client attempting to
  impersonate your app, or from emulated environments.

The distribution of these categories for your app should inform when you decide
to enable enforcement. Here are some guidelines:

- If almost all of the recent requests are from verified clients, consider
  enabling enforcement to start protecting your backend resources.

- If a significant portion of the recent requests are from likely-outdated
  clients, to avoid disrupting users, consider waiting for more users to update
  your app before enabling enforcement. Enforcing App Check on a released
  app will break prior app versions that are not integrated with the
  App Check SDK.

- If your app hasn't launched yet, you should enable App Check enforcement
  immediately, since there aren't any outdated clients in use.

### Cloud Functions {:#metrics-functions}

For Cloud Functions, you can get App Check metrics by examining your
functions' logs. Every invocation of a callable function emits a structured log
entry like the following example:

```json
{
  "severity": "INFO",    // INFO, WARNING, or ERROR
  "logging.googleapis.com/labels": {"firebase-log-type": "callable-request-verification"},
  "jsonPayload": {
    "message": "Callable header verifications passed.",
    "verifications": {
      // ...
      "app": "MISSING",  // VALID, INVALID, or MISSING
    }
  }
}
```

You can analyze these metrics in the Google Cloud Console by [creating a
logs-based counter metric](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/logs-based-metrics/counter-metrics)
with the following metric filter:

```
resource.type="cloud_function"
resource.labels.function_name="YOUR_CLOUD_FUNCTION"
resource.labels.region="us-central1"
labels.firebase-log-type="callable-request-verification"
```

[Label the metric](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/logs-based-metrics/labels#create-label)
using the field `jsonPayload.verifications.appCheck`.


## 5. Enable enforcement {:#enable-enforcement}

To enable enforcement, follow the instructions for each product, below. Once you
enable enforcement for a product, all unverified requests to that product will
be rejected.

### Realtime Database, Cloud Firestore, and Cloud Storage {:#enable-other}

To enable enforcement for Realtime Database, Cloud Firestore (iOS and Android), and Cloud Storage:

1.  Open the [**Project Settings > App Check**](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/appcheck)
    section of the Firebase console.

1.  Expand the metrics view of the product for which you want to enable
    enforcement.

1.  Click **Enforce** and confirm your choice.

Note that it can take up to 10 minutes after you enable enforcement for it to
take effect.

### Cloud Functions {:#enable-functions}

See [Enable App Check enforcement for Cloud Functions](/docs/app-check/cloud-functions).
