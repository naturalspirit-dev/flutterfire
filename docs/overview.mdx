Welcome to FlutterFire! 🔥

FlutterFire is a set of Flutter plugins which connect your Flutter application to [Firebase](https://firebase.com).

## Get to know Firebase for Flutter

If you're new to using Firebase in Flutter we recommend starting with the
[Get to know Firebase for Flutter codelab](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-get-to-know-flutter) and video:

<YouTube id="wUSkeTaBonA" />

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, the documentation assumes you are able to create (or have an existing) Flutter project and also
have an active Firebase project. If you do not meet these prerequisites, follow the links below:

- [Getting Started with Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- [Create a new Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

## Installation

:::caution
Are you migrating your existing project to these new plugins? Please start with the <a href="https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/migration"><b>migration guide</b></a>.
:::

Before any Firebase services can be used, you must first install the [`firebase_core`](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_core)
plugin, which is responsible for connecting your application to Firebase. Add the plugin to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml {4} title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: "^{{ plugins.firebase_core_ns }}"
```

Install the plugin by running the following command from the project root:

```bash
$ flutter pub get
```

## Initializing FlutterFire

⚡ **️FlutterFire now supports initialization directly from Dart!** ⚡️

Before any of the Firebase services can be used, FlutterFire needs to be initialized (you can think of this process as
FlutterFire "bootstrapping" itself). The initialization step is asynchronous, meaning you'll need to prevent any FlutterFire
related usage until the initialization is completed.

:::tip

If you're using FlutterFire in an existing application, you can safely remove any manual native installation
steps (such as the `google-services.json` or `GoogleService-Info.plist` files). Dart-only initialization
is backwards compatible with [manual-installation](./manual-installation.mdx).

:::

### Using the CLI

To initialize FlutterFire, call the [`initializeApp`](!firebase_core.Firebase.initializeApp) method on the [`Firebase`](!firebase_core.Firebase) class.
The method accepts your Firebase project application credentials, which cab be obtained for all supported platforms by using the FlutterFire CLI:

```bash
# Install the CLI if not already done so
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

# Run the `configure` command, select a Firebase project and platforms
flutterfire configure
```

Once configured, a `firebase_options.dart` file will be generated for you containing all of the options
required for initialization.

View the [CLI documentation](./cli.mdx) to learn more!

### Initialization

Next the generated options need to be provided to the [`initializeApp`](!firebase_core.Firebase.initializeApp) method.
The method is asynchronous and returns a [`Future`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/Future-class.html), so
you need to ensure it has completed before displaying your main application. The examples below show how this can be
achieved with a [`FutureBuilder`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FutureBuilder-class.html).

First import the generated `firebase_options.dart` file:

```dart title="lib/main.dart"
import 'firebase_options.dart';
```

Next, pass the `currentPlatform` options from the `DefaultFirebaseOptions` class to the [`initializeApp`](!firebase_core.Firebase.initializeApp) method:

```dart title="lib/main.dart"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// Import the firebase_core plugin
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';

// Import the generated options from the CLI
import 'firebase_options.dart';


void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  runApp(App());
}

/// We are using a StatefulWidget such that we only create the [Future] once,
/// no matter how many times our widget rebuild.
/// If we used a [StatelessWidget], in the event where [App] is rebuilt, that
/// would re-initialize FlutterFire and make our application re-enter loading state,
/// which is undesired.
class App extends StatefulWidget {
  // Create the initialization Future outside of `build`:
  @override
  _AppState createState() => _AppState();
}

class _AppState extends State<App> {
  /// The future is part of the state of our widget. We should not call `initializeApp`
  /// directly inside [build].
  final Future<FirebaseApp> _initialization = Firebase.initializeApp(
    options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
  );

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FutureBuilder(
      // Initialize FlutterFire:
      future: _initialization,
      builder: (context, snapshot) {
        // Check for errors
        if (snapshot.hasError) {
          return SomethingWentWrong();
        }

        // Once complete, show your application
        if (snapshot.connectionState == ConnectionState.done) {
          return MyAwesomeApp();
        }

        // Otherwise, show something whilst waiting for initialization to complete
        return Loading();
      },
    );
  }
}
```

Once initialized, you're ready to get started using FlutterFire!

## Manual Installation

With Dart-only initialization now supported, manually configuring and installing platforms is no longer
required. If you wish to view the documentation for manual initialization, view the
[Manual Installation](./manual-installation/index.mdx) documentation.

## Improve iOS Build Times

Currently the Firestore iOS SDK depends on some 500k lines of mostly C++ code which can take upwards of 5 minutes to build in XCode. To reduce build times significantly, you can use a pre-compiled version by adding 1 line to your `ios/Podfile` inside your Flutter project;

`pod 'FirebaseFirestore', :git => 'https://github.com/invertase/firestore-ios-sdk-frameworks.git', :tag => '8.9.0'`

Add this line inside your target 'Runner' do block in your Podfile, e.g.:

```
# ...
target 'Runner' do
  pod 'FirebaseFirestore', :git => 'https://github.com/invertase/firestore-ios-sdk-frameworks.git', :tag => '8.9.0'
# ...
end
```

Additionally, ensure that you have upgraded your cocoapods to 1.9.1 or higher:
`gem install cocoapods`

For more information see this issue: https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire/issues/2751

## Overriding Native SDK Versions

FlutterFire internally sets the versions of the native SDKs that each module uses. Each release is tested against a fixed
set of SDK version to ensure everything works as expected.

If you wish to change these versions, you can manually override the native SDK versions

### Android

In the `/android/app/build.gradle` file, you can provide your own versions using the options shown below:

```groovy
rootProject.ext {
  set('FlutterFire', [
    FirebaseSDKVersion: '29.0.0'
  ])
}
```

### iOS/MacOS

Open your `/ios/Podfile` or `/macos/Podfile` file and add any of the globals below to the top of the file:

```ruby
# Override Firebase SDK Version
$FirebaseSDKVersion = '8.9.0'
```

## Next Steps

On its own the [`firebase_core`](!firebase_core) plugin provides basic functionality for usage with Firebase. FlutterFire is broken down
into several individual installable plugins that allow you to integrate with a specific Firebase service.

The table below lists all of the currently supported plugins. You can follow the documentation for each plugin to
get started:
