title: Measure Ecommerce
---

[Ecommerce](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9786881)
allows measurement of user interactions with products across your
users' shopping experiences, including interactions such as product (item) list
views, product list clicks, viewing product details, adding a product to a
shopping cart, initiating the checkout process, purchases, and refunds.

For details on implementing ecommerce web apps, see [Google Analytics Ecommerce](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/ecommerce).

## Before you begin

Make sure that youâ€™ve set up your project and can access Analytics as described
in [Get Started with Analytics](/docs/analytics/get-started). Ecommerce
measurement requires you to link your Firebase project to an Analytics
account and to have the Android SDK v17.3.0 or iOS v6.20.0 and up in your app.

## Implementation

A typical ecommerce implementation measures any of the following actions:

* [Select a product from a list](#select_product)
* [View product details](#view_product)
* [Add/remove a product from a shopping cart](#add_remove_product)
* [Initiate the checkout process](#initiate_checkout)
* [Make purchases or refunds](#make_purchase_refund)
* [Apply promotions](#apply_promotions)

At the heart of these actions are products. Products can be instrumented as an
array of items that can be added to prescribed ecommerce events. The following
example demonstrates how to create a collection of **items** that are referenced
throughout this guide.

```dart
// A pair of jeggings
final jeggings = AnalyticsEventItem(
    itemId: "SKU_123",
    itemName: "jeggings",
    itemCategory: "pants",
    itemVariant: "black",
    itemBrand: "Google",
    price: 9.99,
);

// A pair of boots
final boots = AnalyticsEventItem(
    itemId: "SKU_456",
    itemName: "boots",
    itemCategory: "shoes",
    itemVariant: "brown",
    itemBrand: "Google",
    price: 24.99,
);

// A pair of socks
final socks = AnalyticsEventItem(
    itemId: "SKU_789",
    itemName: "ankle_socks",
    itemCategory: "socks",
    itemVariant: "red",
    itemBrand: "Google",
    price: 5.99,
);
```

### Select a product from a list {#select_product}

When a user is presented with a list of results, log a `view_item_list` event
including an `items` array parameter containing the displayed products.

```dart
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance.logViewItemList(
    itemListId: "L001",
    itemListName: "Related products",
    items: [jeggings, boots, socks],
);
```

Once a user selects a particular product from the list, log a `select_item`
event with the chosen product in an `items` array parameter.

```dart
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance.logSelectItem(
    itemListId: "L001",
    itemListName: "Related products",
    items: [jeggings],
);
```

### View product details {#view_product}

To measure how many times product details are viewed, log a `view_item` event
whenever a user views a product's details screen.

```dart
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance.logViewItem(
    currency: 'USD',
    value: 9.99,
    items: [jeggings],
);
```

### Add or remove a product from a shopping cart {#add_remove_product}

Measure a product being added to a wishlist or cart by logging an
`add_to_wishlist` or `add_to_cart` event, respectively, with the relevant
products in an `items` array parameter.

```dart
final jeggingsWithQuantity = AnalyticsEventItem(
    itemId: jeggings.itemId,
    itemName: jeggings.itemName,
    itemCategory: jeggings.itemCategory,
    itemVariant: jeggings.itemVariant,
    itemBrand: jeggings.itemBrand,
    price: jeggings.price,
    quantity: 2,
);
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance.logAddToWishlist(
    currency: 'USD',
    value: 19.98,
    items: [jeggingsWithQuantity],
);
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance.logAddToCart(
    currency: 'USD',
    value: 19.98,
    items: [jeggingsWithQuantity],
);
```

When a user subsequently views the cart, log the `view_cart` event with all
`items` in the cart.

```dart
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance.logViewCart(
    currency: 'USD',
    value: 19.98,
    items: [jeggingsWithQuantity],
);
```

To measure when a user removes a product from a cart, log the
`remove_from_cart` event.

```dart
final jeggingsWithQuantity = AnalyticsEventItem(
    itemId: jeggings.itemId,
    itemName: jeggings.itemName,
    itemCategory: jeggings.itemCategory,
    itemVariant: jeggings.itemVariant,
    itemBrand: jeggings.itemBrand,
    price: jeggings.price,
    quantity: 1,
);
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance.logRemoveFromCart(
    currency: 'USD',
    value: 9.99,
    items: [jeggingsWithQuantity],
);
```

### Initiate the checkout process {#initiate_checkout}

Measure the first step in a checkout process by logging a `begin_checkout` event
with one or more `items` defined with the relevant fields. A coupon can also be
added at this stage to the entire order by adding it to the event or applied to
a particular item by adding it to specific elements in the `items` array.

```dart
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance.logBeginCheckout(
    currency: 'USD',
    value: 15.98,  // Discount applied.
    coupon: "SUMMER_FUN",
    items: [jeggingsWithQuantity],
);
```

When a user proceeds to the next step in the checkout process and adds shipping
information, log an `add_shipping_info` event. Use the parameter `shipping_tier`
to specify the user's delivery option, such as "Ground", "Air", or "Next-day".

```dart
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance.logAddShippingInfo(
    currency: 'USD',
    value: 15.98,
    coupon: "SUMMER_FUN",
    shippingTier: "Ground",
    items: [jeggingsWithQuantity],
);
```

Log `add_payment_info` when a user submits their payment information. If
applicable, include `payment_type` with this event for the chosen method of
payment.

```dart
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance.logAddPaymentInfo(
    currency: 'USD',
    value: 15.98,
    coupon: "SUMMER_FUN",
    paymentType: "Visa",
    items: [jeggingsWithQuantity],
);
```

### Make a purchase or issue a refund {#make_purchase_refund}

Measure a purchase by logging a `purchase` event with one or more `items`
defined with the relevant fields.

```dart
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance.logPurchase(
    transactionId: "12345",
    affiliation: "Google Store",
    currency: 'USD',
    value: 15.98,
    shipping: 2.00,
    tax: 1.66,
    coupon: "SUMMER_FUN",
    items: [jeggingsWithQuantity],
);
```

:::note
The purchase event replaces `ecommerce_purchase` and is different from the
`in_app_purchase` event, which is reported automatically.
:::

Measure refunds by logging a `refund` event with the relevant `transaction_id`
specified and optionally (for partial refunds) one or more `items` defined with
`item_id` and `quantity`.

```dart
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance.logRefund(
    transactionId: "12345",
    affiliation: "Google Store",
    currency: 'USD',
    value: 15.98,
    items: [jeggingsWithQuantity],
);
```

:::note
The `refund` event replaces `ecommerce_refund`.
:::

### Apply promotions {#apply_promotions}

Ecommerce includes support for measuring impressions and clicks of internal
promotions, such as banners displayed to promote a sale.

Promotion impressions are typically measured with the initial screen view by
logging the `view_promotion` event with an `items` parameter to specify the
promoted product. To indicate a user clicked on a promotion, log a
`select_promotion` event with that product as an `item` parameter.

```dart
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance.logViewPromotion(
    promotionId: "SUMMER_FUN",
    promotionName: "Summer Sale",
    creativeName: "summer2020_promo.jpg",
    creativeSlot: "featured_app_1",
    locationId: "HERO_BANNER",
);

await FirebaseAnalytics.instance.logSelectPromotion(
    promotionId: "SUMMER_FUN",
    promotionName: "Summer Sale",
    creativeName: "summer2020_promo.jpg",
    creativeSlot: "featured_app_1",
    locationId: "HERO_BANNER",
);
```
