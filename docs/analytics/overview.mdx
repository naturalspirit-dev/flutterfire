## Installation

### 1. Make sure to initialize Firebase

[Follow this guide](../overview.mdx) to install `firebase_core` and initialize Firebase if you haven't already.

### 2. Add dependency

On the root of your Flutter project, run the following command to install the plugin:

```bash {5}
flutter pub add firebase_analytics
```

### 3. Rebuild your app

Once complete, rebuild your Flutter application:

```bash
flutter run
```

### 4. (optional) Apple [App Tracking Transparency](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency)

If you wish to use Firebase Analytics without IDFA collection capability, open your `/{ios|macos}/Podfile` and add the following global variable to the top of the file:

```ruby
$FirebaseAnalyticsWithoutAdIdSupport = true
```

## Next Steps

Once installed, you're ready to start using Analytics in your Flutter Project.
