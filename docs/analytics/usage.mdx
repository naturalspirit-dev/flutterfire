Once installed, you can access the [`firebase_analytics`](!firebase_analytics) plugin by importing it in your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:firebase_analytics/firebase_analytics.dart';
```

Before using Firebase Analytics, you must first have ensured you have [initialized FlutterFire](../overview.mdx#initializing-flutterfire).

To create a new Firebase Analytics instance, call the [`instance`](!firebase_analytics.FirebaseAnalytics.instance) getter on [`FirebaseAnalytics`](!firebase_auth.FirebaseAnalytics):

```dart
FirebaseAnalytics analytics = FirebaseAnalytics.instance;
```

By default, this allows you to interact with Firebase Analytics using the default Firebase App used whilst installing FlutterFire on your
platform.

If you'd like to use a secondary Firebase Analytics, use the [`instanceFor`](!firebase_auth.FirebaseAnalytics.instanceFor) method - note multi-app support
is only available on the web:

```dart
// Only supported on web!
FirebaseApp secondaryApp = Firebase.app('SecondaryApp');
FirebaseAnalytics analytics = FirebaseAnalytics.instanceFor(app: secondaryApp);
```

## Logging events

The plugin supports logging both custom and predefined events to Analytics.

### Custom events

You can log custom events by calling the `logEvent` method. The method accepts an event name (which will
be shown in the Analytics dashboard), along with any additional parameters for the event.

```dart
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance
  .logEvent(
    name: 'view_product',
    parameters: {
      'product_id': 1234,
    }
  );
```

Note; if the event name is reserved or starts with `firebase_`, an error will be thrown.

### Predefined events

The plugin exposes a number of methods which accept a set of parameters which Firebase Analytics expects
when a given event is called. For example, the `logBeginCheckout` event can be called when the user
starts a checkout flow on your application. It accepts the value, currency, checkout items and coupon
values:

```dart
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance
  .logBeginCheckout(
    value: 10.0,
    currency: 'USD',
    items: [
      Item(
        item_name: 'Socks',
        item_id: 'xjw73ndnw',
        price: '10.0'
      ),
    ],
    coupon: '10PERCENTOFF'
  );
```

The `Item` class provided above is a class which represents *some* item which is sent to Analytics. It
accepts a number of predefined parameters which will be used for analysis on the dashboard. Although
optional, to get the best experience from Firebase Analytics it is best to ensure as many relevant
parameters are provided.

You can learn more about the `Item` class [here](!firebase_analytics_platform_interface.Item).

Below is a table containing all predefined events available from the plugin:

## Screen tracking

Use `setCurrentScreen` to track each unique screen the user is selecting and build a picture of the most relevant screens in your application:

```dart
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance
  .setCurrentScreen(
    screenName: 'Products'
  );
```

## Default Parameters

Use the `setDefaultEventParameters` method if you have common parameters which need to be sent with each event:

```dart
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance
  .setDefaultEventParameters({
    version: '1.2.3'
  });
```

## Setting user properties

Use the `setUserId` method to set the current analytics session to assign events to the user's `id`:

```dart
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance
  .setUserId({
    id: 'xxxxxxx'
  });
```

The `id` can be set to `null` to remove the ID.

If you have any user properties to attach to the user, call the `setUserProperty` method:

```dart
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance
  .setUserProperty({
    name: 'age',
    value: 18
  });
```

You can provide a `null` value to remove any previous properties.

## Resetting data

To clear all data associated with the current session, use the `resetAnalyticsData` method:

```dart
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance
  .resetAnalyticsData();
```
