title: Set user properties
---

User properties are attributes you define to describe segments of your user base,
such as language preference or geographic location. These can be used to define
[audiences](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6317509?hl=en&ref_topic=6317489)
for your app. This guide shows you how to set user properties in your app.

Analytics automatically logs some [user
properties](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6317486); you don't need
to add any code to enable them. If you need to collect additional data, you can
set up to 25 different Analytics User Properties per project. Note that
user property names are case-sensitive and that setting two user properties
whose names differ only in case results in two distinct user properties being
logged.

You can't use a small set of user property names reserved by Google:

<ul>
<li><strong>Age</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gender</strong></li>
<li><strong>Interest</strong></li>
</ul>

## Before you begin

Make sure that you've set up your project and can access Analytics as
described in [Get Started with Analytics](get-started).

## Set user properties

You can set Analytics User Properties to describe the users of your app.
You can analyze behaviors of various user segments by applying these
properties as filters to your reports.

Set a user property as follows:

1. Register the property in the [** User Properties ** page](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/analytics/userproperty)
   of Analytics in the Firebase console. For more information, see
   [Set and register a user property](//support.google.com/firebase/answer/6317519?hl=en&ref_topic=6317489#create-property).
1. Add code to set an Analytics User Property with the `setUserProperty()`
   method.

The following example
adds a hypothetical favorite food property, which assigns the value in
`favoriteFood` to the active user:

```dart
await FirebaseAnalytics.instance
  .setUserProperty({
    name: 'favorite_food',
    value: favoriteFood,
  });
```
